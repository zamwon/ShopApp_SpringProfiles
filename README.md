# ShopApp_SpringProfiles
Implement an online store that offers 3 variants. The basic functionality that each store has is the "START" variant. It allows you to add products to the basket (the product stores the name and price), and based on them, display the price of all products in the console window. The "PLUS" package additionally allows adding VAT to the resulting price. The VAT rate is to be included in the configuration file. In addition to calculating the tax, the "PRO" package also has the option of calculating a discount, the value of which is included in the configuration file. The starter application adds any 5 products with a random price (in the range of PLN 50-300) and displays their total price.
